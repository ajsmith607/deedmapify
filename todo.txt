CURRENT TODO
====================

- [x] globals:
    - [x] retro test existing, include files
    - [x] define output formats

- [x] property cascade
    - [x] simple properties overwrite, enumerated properties append

- [x] pretty bearings on steplabelformat output

- [x] implement print scaling
    - [x] output scale in metadata

- [x] svg file must be created at least

- [x] how is scale determined now? 
    - [x] move-and-rotate method also scales?
    - [x] Max bounding box = printscale + margin 
    - [x] scale layers after all layers are compiled
    - [x] align after scaling
    - [x] default scale =0, only set it scale=0, otherwise, assume value set overrides
    - [x] add dpi to savepng code

- [-] implement points, point types
    - [x] describe methods
    - [x] methods to connect, align, etc.

- [ ] finish map definitions
    - [x] final Tract III config
    - [x] adjust label placement
    - [x] rules

- [ ] metadata, context improvements
    - [ ] line/text styling cleanup, test (at group/layer level)
    - [x] line color legend
    - [ ] metadata title, border color
    - [ ] title, desc, notes  at layer and file levels

- [ ] initial Hugo site setup for DeedMapify
- [ ] create shortcode ? 
- [x] make grids gray again
- [x] rule lines go in one direction like lines (rules go through points only?, open(one point, dist,angle) closed (2 points), rules get numbered like steps)
- [x] config file recursively includes?

Known Bugs
==========

- [x] true north map is not showing right angles? (isolate and add debugging messages) 

Future Enhancements
====================

- [ ] right angles not always detected as expected, need to reconsider default tolerance?
- [ ] add "chainlinks" as input and output format, test, or is this/should this be covered by "chains" methods? 
- [ ] splitwords should use one **or more** spaces as delimiters for more robust parsing
- [ ] make splitwords more robust with more sophisticated handling of quotes?
- [ ] test: notes, citations, and instructions append to list
- [ ] global config
    - [ ] implement template files 
    - [ ] specify output, images, template dir, etc? 
    - [ ] display flags? files/layers append or override? (default overrides, add addflags param at file level to append or use +flag -flag notation?)
- [ ] geocode physical addresses
- [ ] lookup magnetic declination for lat/lon/date
- [ ] cache results
- [ ] PDF output

Infrastructure Enhancements
========================

- [x] clean up unused image files in maps/images
- [ ] likely "compile" code in SVGHelper that more logically belongs in the MapLayer package
- [ ] factor out general utility functions from MapMath package
- [ ] integrate Winston logging, clean up logging messages
- [ ] validate yaml, give feedback      
- [ ] more robust error checking/validation in general
- [ ] consider using TypeScript on MapMath package
